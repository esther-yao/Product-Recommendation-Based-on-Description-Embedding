- Description: Use deep learning techniques to make Amazon product recommendation based on the similarity between different product description embeddings.
- Method: Build and finetune various baseline and advanced NLP models, including Bag of Words, Doc2Vec, seq2seq, BERT, and SBERT. Apply techniques such as PCA and whitening for demsnionality reduction. Design proper metrics (harmonic mean of within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity) for our task.
- Result: Among all the models, SBERT yields the best result, which gives a harmonic mean of 0.69. Compared to traditional recommendation systems built upon content-based filtering or collaborative filtering, our model is able to recommend products more accurately and efficiently.
